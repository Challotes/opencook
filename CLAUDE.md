# BSVibes — AI Context File

> **If you're an AI reading this:** This file is your onboarding. Read it fully before writing any code.
> After completing significant work, update the relevant context files (DIRECTION.md, DECISIONS.md, ROADMAP.md) with what you changed and why.

## What This Is

A platform that builds itself. It started as a post board and evolves based on user contributions. Every post is logged on-chain (BSV). An Agentic Fairness system tracks contributions and distributes value. Eventually, any idea can spawn into its own project with the same model.

**Tagline:** "A platform that builds itself, then lets anyone do the same."
**Subtitle:** Agentic Fairness

## Toolkit

This project is built using the **bOpen.ai toolkit** (agents, skills, plugins). bOpen is the tooling, not the product. The product is BSVibes.

## Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19.2 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Build:** Turbopack (dev + prod), React Compiler enabled (`reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts`)
- **Linter/Formatter:** Biome (`biome.json`) — replaced ESLint 2026-03-25. Full auto-format pass applied 2026-04-10 (0 lint errors across 69 files).
- **Database:** SQLite (better-sqlite3) for local dev, file: `local.db`
- **Blockchain:** BSV via `@bsv/sdk` — keypair generation, signing, on-chain logging
- **Identity:** Auto-generated BSV keypair stored in browser localStorage
- **Styling:** Dark theme (zinc/black palette), Telegram/X/GPT hybrid UI

## Key Files

### API Routes

- `src/app/api/posts/route.ts` — Feed polling (GET, ?since_id for incremental updates)
- `src/app/api/boot-shares/route.ts` — Contributor shares + boot price for client-side tx building
- `src/app/api/boot-confirm/route.ts` — Records boot after client broadcasts (rawTx + local P2PKH parsing, self-authenticating hash(rawTx)===txid check, ARC re-broadcast safety net, replay protection, rate limiting). **Booter auth (Step 7):** requires an ECDSA signature over `boot:<postId>:<txid>` (`boot-message.ts`); the credited address (`bootboard.boosted_by` + `boot_grants`) is DERIVED from the verified pubkey, never client-supplied — closes boot-attribution forgery. Payouts come from the server-recomputed split, not client input.
- `src/app/api/boot-status/route.ts` — Free boots remaining + boot price for a user
- `src/app/api/earnings/route.ts` — Total earned, activity feed, earnings history for chart
- `src/app/api/agent/route.ts` — Streaming agent chat (SSE, rate-limited)
- `src/app/api/tx-hex/route.ts` — WhatsOnChain raw-tx proxy (cached, retries, stale fallback)
- `src/app/api/balance/route.ts` — WhatsOnChain balance proxy (10s cache, 120/min, graceful fallback on 429)
- `src/app/api/unspent/route.ts` — WhatsOnChain UTXO proxy (3s cache, 180/min, retries with stale fallback)
### Server Actions & Data

- `src/app/actions.ts` — Server actions. Reads (no signature): getPosts, getNewPosts, getUpdatedPosts, getOlderPosts, getBootboard. Mutations (signature-verified): createPost, bootPost.
- `src/lib/db.ts` — SQLite setup (WAL, foreign keys, auto-migration, indexes, boot_grants + payouts tables)
- `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` — In-memory sliding window rate limiter
- `src/lib/boot-message.ts` — `bootConfirmMessage(postId, txid)` → `boot:<postId>:<txid>`, the canonical string the booter signs for `/api/boot-confirm`. Single source of truth shared by the client (`useBoot`) and server (boot-confirm) so the signed message is byte-identical. Unit-tested (incl. sign↔verify round-trip) in `boot-message.test.ts`.
- `src/lib/free-boot-cap.ts` — Per-IP cap on SERVER-FUNDED free boots (`tryConsumeFreeBootForIp`, 40/IP/24h, reuses rate-limit.ts). Additive defense behind the per-identity `boot_grants` cap, bounding the "fresh identity per incognito tab" server-wallet drain. Fails toward PAID, never fail-open. Consulted by `bootPost` only when the per-identity grant would make the boot free. Unit-tested in `free-boot-cap.test.ts`.
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — Shared utilities (generateAnonName, cn helper)
- `src/data/agent-prompt.ts` — Dynamic agent prompt builder (loads MDs at request time)
- `src/data/genesis.ts` — Genesis conversation data
- `src/lib/install-pitch.ts` — Pure 5-condition visibility-gate predicate for the install pitch (backedUp + protected + not-standalone + supported-platform + not-engaged). Returns boolean. Unit-tested in `src/lib/install-pitch.test.ts`.

### Pages & Components

- `src/app/page.tsx` — Main entry (server component, 10s ISR)
- `src/app/Feed.tsx` — Client orchestrator: polling, optimistic posts, pagination
- `src/app/Header.tsx` — Top bar with logo, genesis nav, identity chip
- `src/app/PostList.tsx` — Post rendering, BootButton, Genesis anchor
- `src/app/PostForm.tsx` — Compose box (enter-to-post, voice-to-text, agent chat trigger)
- `src/app/IdentityBar.tsx` — Identity chip + You modal. Amber brand theme (#f59e0b). Earnings-first hierarchy: all-time earnings (hero) → activity (2 visible, "View all" toggle) → balance (demoted, inline "Add funds" link). Protected state = inline checkmark (X-verified pattern); unprotected = red banner (static dot, no pulse) → opens `ProtectModal` (encrypt-in-place flow). **Locked-state You modal:** the You modal opens locked for protected users (`manageAuthed === false`) showing a passphrase prompt as the body. On unlock, the body cross-fades to the rows (Save / Passphrase / Restore / Show recovery key). One container, two states; same modal, body swap with `animate-[fadeIn_0.2s_ease-out]`. Session destroyed on modal close OR tab blur (password-manager pattern). Show recovery key + Restore still re-prompt (defense-in-depth on highest-stakes paths — see DECISIONS.md). Show recovery key panel: red warning (*"Anyone who has this key controls your account and any funds in it. Never share it — not with support, not with friends, not with anyone."*) + acknowledgement-gated Reveal → side-by-side Hide/Copy. The in-app reveal is the only WIF surface that retains a Copy button — the manage gate + acknowledgement is sufficient defense for an in-session reveal; downloaded files have Copy buttons removed from all WIF surfaces (see backup-template entry). Earnings poll 30s — full feed when dropdown open, summary only when closed. Passphrase row icon goes neutral (zinc-400) when protected — color is reserved for active warnings (red unprotected, amber for unsaved backup). `closeDropdown` resets all sub-disclosures (`showAdvanced`, `keyRevealed`, `copied`, `activityExpanded`) so reopen always starts in default state. Currency display auto-flips to Goat (sats) the first time a user becomes protected via the `useCurrencyMode` protection-aware default; one-time `GoatModeToast` surfaces the change. **Locked-state chip is invisible** — the chip renders the cached anon name (from `getStoredAnonName()` reading the encrypted store's plaintext `name` field) so the site looks signed in even when locked. Clicking the chip while locked opens `<SignInModal>` (centered modal, not the You modal). The previous ambient pill / shake / `LockedClickCatcher` machinery has been replaced — see DECISIONS.md "Sign-in trigger: centered modal, no global catcher".
- `src/components/RestoreModal.tsx` — Standalone restore-from-device modal (extracted from IdentityBar). Accepts encrypted recovery files only — legacy plaintext files and any file lacking `fileVersion: 1` are rejected with an `unsupported_version` error (intentional "start clean" policy; see `restore-from-file.ts`). When restoring from an encrypted file, the passphrase the user types to decrypt becomes the passphrase guarding the new identity going forward via `importEncryptedIdentity` (the file's hint is preserved too). Save current key prompt before import (explicit "Save current key" / "Skip" with two-step skip confirmation); Save uses `shareOrDownloadBackup` (Web Share API on iOS, `<a download>` fallback elsewhere). The outgoing backup payload is built lazily in a `useEffect` so the Save click handler can call `shareOrDownloadBackup` synchronously (iOS transient activation can't survive an `await encryptWif` before share). Wired to `blockSessionClear()` on the doImport / performImport / handleSaveOldKey paths to prevent iOS system sheets from torching the modal mid-flow. Parent's `onSuccess` no longer dismisses the modal — done state stays visible until the user taps Got it.
- `src/app/Bootboard.tsx` — Pay-to-feature spotlight (live timer, shake/glow animations)
- `src/app/Manifesto.tsx` — Vision TLDR block above Genesis
- `src/app/Genesis.tsx` — Founding conversation (always visible, NOT collapsible)
- `src/app/AgentChat.tsx` — AI Q&A modal (streaming via /api/agent). Pill carries a small decorative GitHub octocat (14x14, `text-zinc-300` rest, `text-amber-200/70` during `highlight` state to harmonize with the amber pulse) AFTER the "Ask AI" label — purely a visual signal, not a separate click target. The pill click still opens the modal as it always did. Modal has a centered open-source footer below the input row (`border-zinc-800/50`, `text-xs text-zinc-300`) with the repo link + tagline *"The code is open."* + `↗` arrow. Casual users notice nothing; investigators see the icon → click pill → see the link in the modal footer → click through. The icon is shown in BOTH normal and highlight states because the manifesto's "Chat with the agent" CTA puts the pill into highlight, and that's exactly when the open-source signal is most contextually relevant. Don't make the pill icon a separate click target — that would split the pill into two tap targets and break the affordance. See DECISIONS.md "GitHub link: pill tease + modal footer".
- `src/app/FundAddress.tsx` — Centered Deposit modal matching the You modal / SignInModal shell (`max-w-sm`, gold top stripe, `border-amber-400/20`, `#0f0f0f` bg). Body: 180px QR code (`qrcode.react` SVG, white-on-black, scannable across all wallets), balance + boot cost breakdown (when bootPrice context exists with shortfall in amber), click-to-copy address row, primary Copy Address button. Closes on backdrop click + close X.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Root layout (metadata, fonts, IdentityProvider wrapper)
- `src/app/error.tsx` — Error boundary
- `src/components/PassphrasePrompt.tsx` — Reusable passphrase input with hint display
- `src/components/ProtectModal.tsx` — "Protect" flow for unprotected accounts. Collects a passphrase and calls `encryptInPlace` — the existing key/address is encrypted in localStorage with no rotation, no sweep, no migration. Same key forever; passphrase wraps it. On success emits a recovery file (`pathType: "save"`) and updates the global `backedUp` flag only on explicit save acknowledgement. Opened by IdentityBar when the user clicks the unprotected red banner.
- `src/components/ChangePassphraseModal.tsx` — Change passphrase flow (verify current → enter new → backup, or new → backup when `preVerifiedPassphrase` is passed in from the manage gate). Calls `changePassphrase` — re-encrypts the SAME key under the new passphrase. Address and key material are unchanged. After success transitions to a `'done'` step showing `Download again` + `Got it`; `doneBackup` state captures the `BackupData` so re-download is available. Recovery file uses `pathType: "save"` (single key, single address — no previous-key block).
- `src/components/AnimatedBalance.tsx` — Animated balance counter (count-up, green flash)
- `src/components/EarningsSparkline.tsx` — Step-function area chart (pure SVG)
- `src/components/icons/BootIcon.tsx` — Boot emoji icon
- `src/components/BootToast.tsx` — Transient boot error toast (retry action, auto-dismiss)
- `src/components/GoatModeToast.tsx` — One-time celebratory toast on first auto-flip to Goat Mode after first protect (gated by `bsvibes_goat_welcome_shown` localStorage flag)
- `src/components/SignInModal.tsx` — Centered modal opened by `requireIdentity()`. Mounted inside `<IdentityProvider>` in `Feed.tsx`. Container mirrors the You modal locked-state: `max-w-sm`, gold top stripe, `border-amber-400/20`, header with "Sign in" title + close X. Body: full-width passphrase input, "Need a reminder?" two-step click-to-reveal hint (`💡 {hint}` in amber left-border treatment), Cancel + Sign in buttons in a `flex-1` row. On success calls `unlockIdentity()` + `updateIdentity()` then `closeSignIn()`. Wrong-passphrase fires local shake (NOT context) + "Wrong passphrase, try again." error. Closes on backdrop click, Escape, OR tab blur (password-manager parity — clears all input state). No auto-replay: caller retaps action after signing in.
- `src/components/HomeScreenWelcomeGate.tsx` — First-load gate shown only in PWA standalone mode on a tab that has no identity yet. Routes between "Start fresh" (auto-generate keypair) and "I have a recovery file" (opens `RestoreModal`).
- `src/components/IosStorageToast.tsx` — Transient warning shown to iOS standalone PWA users about ITP storage clearing. Sequenced behind any other modal flow per LAUNCH_PLAN D4.
- `src/components/FirstEarningToast.tsx` — One-time celebratory toast when a user's first payout lands. Suppression key `bsvibes_first_earning_save_dismissed_until` (ISO timestamp), 48h backoff whether the user taps Save or Later. CTA flows into the save-recovery-file path.
- `src/components/InstallPitch.tsx` — Two-variant install-pitch component. `variant="inline"` renders the row inside the You modal done-state (one-tap platforms fire `promptInstall` directly; manual-instructions platforms open the slide-up sheet). `variant="banner"` mounts globally in `Feed.tsx` and drives the slide-up sheet via `installSheetMode` from `InstallContext`. Sheet has a chevron-minimise to `<InstallBookmark>` — no timer-based dismissal anywhere. See DECISIONS.md "Install pitch surfaces — no timer-based dismissal".
- `src/components/InstallBookmark.tsx` — Minimised state of the install pitch. 34×34 chip (30px BSVibes icon inside `border-zinc-800`, geometry matches Ask AI pill exactly) centered in the PostForm footer's `grid-cols-3` row. Tap re-opens the slide-up sheet. Highlight flash fires on sheet→bookmark collapse so the eye tracks the destination.
### Universal pattern: transaction action requires sign-in

Any action that needs a signed BSV identity (post, boot, tip, future features) follows this one-line pattern at the top of its handler:

```ts
const { identity, requireIdentity } = useIdentityContext();
if (!requireIdentity() || !identity) return;   // opens SignInModal if locked, returns false
// identity is non-null here
```

`requireIdentity()` returns `true` if signed in, otherwise calls `openSignIn()` and returns `false`. The `|| !identity` is a TypeScript narrowing guard. Site looks 100% normal locked — boot buttons not disabled, textarea always enabled, no ambient pill, no shake. Tap → modal opens → user signs in → modal closes → user retaps. Adopted in PostForm `submitForm()`, PostList `BootButton.handleBoot()`, Bootboard `HistoryRow.handleReboot()`. Future toolkit features inherit the pattern with one hook + one line. Read-only actions (AI chat, scrolling, reading posts) NEVER trigger sign-in — that was the explicit reason the previous global `LockedClickCatcher` was deleted.

### BSV Services

- `src/services/bsv/identity.ts` — Keypair generation, signing, encrypted storage. Key functions: `getIdentity`, `signPost`, `encryptInPlace` (adds passphrase protection to an existing unencrypted key — address unchanged), `changePassphrase` (re-encrypts the same key under a new passphrase — address unchanged), `importEncryptedIdentity` (restore from an encrypted recovery file), `unlockIdentity`, `derivePubkeyFromWif`. The key/address never changes after generation.
- `src/services/bsv/crypto.ts` — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt for WIF keys (Web Crypto API)
- `src/services/bsv/backup-template.ts` — Self-contained HTML recovery file generator + `downloadBackup(data)` / `getStoredHint` utilities. `BackupData.pathType` is required (`"save" | "restore-pre"`); no `oldAddress` or `oldWif_encrypted` fields — files are single-key only. Files are stamped with `fileVersion: 1` (`RECOVERY_FILE_VERSION`). HTML template structure: title → subtitle (*"Keep this file somewhere only you can find it."*) → offline badge → metadata card (Name / Address with inline Copy / Saved) → context block → body section (encrypted: passphrase input + decrypt → "Key unlocked" header + WIF block) → footer (monospace stamp `Recovery file · <pathType> · saved <date>` + bsvibes.com link). WIF labels use "secret key" terminology — matches the `IdentityBar` row subtitle *"Secret key — handle with care"*. **Static-render for iOS Quick Look (2026-05-04, refined 2026-05-18):** name, address, saved date, plaintext WIF, hint, and footer stamp all render statically in HTML at template-build time. Dates use fixed `en-US` locale for stable output. **E25 (2026-05-18) — inverse-noscript pattern for iOS Quick Look:** encrypted-variant "Your keys are safe but this preview can't decrypt them" banner is a `<div id="quicklook-notice">` visible by default; `hideQuickLookNotice()` IIFE hides it at script load. **E25 — `<input readonly>` / `<textarea readonly>` for tap-to-select in Quick Look.** **`copyText()` reads `el.value` for form controls, falls back to `el.textContent` for spans.** **Do not pass filenames to `downloadBackup`**, **do not re-add Copy buttons on WIF surfaces**, **do not re-introduce the green "Private & Offline" banner**, **do not revert the `<noscript>` pattern**, **do not switch addresses or WIFs back to spans/divs** — see DECISIONS.md "Backup file audit & overhaul" + "iOS Quick Look noscript / input-readonly pattern".
- `src/services/bsv/restore-from-file.ts` — Pure recovery-file parser (`parseRecoveryFile`). Accepts files with `fileVersion === 1` only. Rejects plaintext files and any file missing the version stamp with `unsupported_version`. Supports the marker-block format. Used by `RestoreModal` and `HomeScreenWelcomeGate`.
- `src/services/bsv/client-boot.ts` — Client-side trustless boot tx builder (browser → contributors, zero custody)
- `src/services/bsv/wallet.ts` — Server wallet with UTXO manager (mutex, spent-blacklist, 0-conf chaining)
- `src/services/bsv/onchain.ts` — OP_RETURN post logging (fire-and-forget)

### OP_RETURN Formats (On-Chain Audit Trail)

All on-chain payloads are JSON inside OP_FALSE OP_RETURN outputs:

**Post logging** (`onchain.ts` — every new post):
`{ app, type: "post", content, author, sig, pubkey, ts }` — sig/pubkey are null for unsigned posts.

**Boot split** (`boot-payment.ts` — every boot payout):
`{ app, action: "boot_split", post_id, total, recipients, formula_version, ts }` — see FAIRNESS.md for details.

### Fairness Pipeline

- `src/services/fairness/config.ts` — Tunable parameters (governance surface)
- `src/services/fairness/pricing.ts` — Dynamic boot price (contributors × 156, floor/ceiling, cached)
- `src/services/fairness/weights.ts` — Contribution scoring (sqrt × decay × engagement). Posts attribute directly to their signing pubkey/address — no migration chain resolution.
- `src/services/fairness/split.ts` — No-custody payout split (every sat out in same tx)
- `src/services/fairness/boot-payment.ts` — Multi-output BSV split transaction builder
- `src/services/fairness/boot-orchestrator.ts` — Full boot workflow (validate → price → score → split → broadcast → record)

### Hooks & Context

- `src/contexts/IdentityContext.tsx` — Shared identity provider (single BSV SDK load). Exposes: `identity`, `isLoading`, `needsUnlock`, `sign()`, `updateIdentity()`, plus the sign-in modal API: `signInOpen`, `openSignIn()`, `closeSignIn()`, `requireIdentity(): boolean`. Also exports `useRequiresIdentity()` ergonomic hook returning `{ identity, requireIdentity }` for callers that only need the guard. Also exposes ref-counted `blockSessionClear()` / `unblockSessionClear()` / `isSessionClearBlocked()` — one shared ref that suppresses BOTH the pagehide-driven `clearSessionCaches()` AND any visibility-related teardown elsewhere (e.g. IdentityBar's `visibilitychange→manageAuthed=false` reset). Used during flows where iOS may fire system sheets (Save Password, Share, Files picker) on standalone PWA — those background blips would otherwise torch an active protect/restore flow. Consumers: ProtectModal, RestoreModal (doImport + performImport). Both have useEffect cleanups as a safety net for mid-flow unmount. IdentityBar reads `isSessionClearBlocked()` to short-circuit its visibilitychange teardown during these flows.
- `src/contexts/BootContext.tsx` — Global boot coordinator: single-flight lock (only one boot in flight at a time across the whole app), 3s UI throttle, status state machine, consolidation-warning dismissal state. Consumed by Bootboard, Feed, PostList, useBoot.
- `src/contexts/InstallContext.tsx` — Global install-pitch state. Exposes the `installSheetMode` state machine (`"hidden" | "sheet" | "bookmark"`), `canPromptInstall` + `promptInstall()` (captures and consumes the `beforeinstallprompt` event for one-tap platforms), `engaged` flag (set on `appinstalled` event or `accepted` outcome — no timer-based suppression), `backedUp` + `protected` derived state, `markBackedUp()` transition, ref-counted `blockInstallPitch()` / `unblockInstallPitch()` / `isInstallPitchBlocked()` (modal-overlap guard — sheet defers fire until protect/passphrase modals close), and `installPitchBlockTick` (React-observable proxy for the ref counter). Cross-tab `storage` listener keeps `backedUp` in sync across tabs.
- `src/hooks/useInstallPlatform.ts` — Detects `installType: "one-tap" | "manual-instructions" | "open-in-safari" | "unsupported"` from UA + capability sniffing. Drives the platform-specific copy in `<InstallPitch>`.
- `src/hooks/useStandaloneMode.ts` — Detects whether the page is already running in PWA standalone mode (used to hide the install pitch entirely if the user is already installed).
- `src/hooks/useIdentity.ts` — React hook for identity management
- `src/hooks/useBoot.ts` — Shared boot logic (free → server, paid → client trustless, consolidation); coordinates with BootContext for global single-flight + 3s throttle
- `src/hooks/useFeedPolling.ts` — Polls /api/posts every 5s (pauses on hidden tab)
- `src/hooks/useScrollTracker.ts` — Scroll position, unread tracking
- `src/hooks/useBsvPrice.ts` — BSV/USD price (cached 5 min)
- `src/hooks/useCurrencyMode.ts` — Noob Mode ($) / Goat Mode (sats) toggle. Default is protection-aware: protected accounts default to Goat, unprotected default to Noob. User's explicit toggle is honored forever once set (`hasUserChosen` derived from localStorage presence). `setModeProgrammatically` lets the parent drive an in-session live switch without persisting or marking the user as having chosen — used for the post-upgrade auto-flip.
- `src/types/index.ts` — Shared types (Post, BootboardData, Identity, etc.)

## Request Flows

**Post creation:**
PostForm → signPost (ECDSA) → createPost server action → verify signature → insert DB → logPostOnChain (fire-and-forget OP_RETURN) → return post ID → optimistic UI update → Feed polls for confirmation

**Boot payment (paid):**
BootButton/useBoot → bootPost server action (checks free quota) → requiresPayment response → fetch /api/boot-shares (split calculation) → clientSideBoot (browser builds multi-output BSV tx) → broadcast via ARC → POST /api/boot-confirm with rawTx + booterPubkey + signature (server verifies the booter's ECDSA signature over `boot:<postId>:<txid>` and derives the credited address from the verified pubkey, verifies hash(rawTx)===txid, parses P2PKH outputs locally to check split, re-broadcasts via ARC as safety net, records payouts, emits TX_CONFLICT vs ARC_UNAVAILABLE codes) → Feed polls for bootboard update

**Boot payment (free):**
BootButton/useBoot → bootPost server action → server wallet builds split tx via boot-orchestrator → broadcast → consume free boot grant → return success

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Server components by default, `'use client'` only when needed
- Server actions for data mutations
- Tailwind for styling — no CSS modules
- Dark theme: bg-black, bg-zinc-900, text-white, border-zinc-800
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Identity System

- BSV keypair auto-generated on first visit via `@bsv/sdk` `PrivateKey.fromRandom()`
- Stored as WIF in localStorage under key `bfn_keypair` (plaintext) or `bfn_keypair_enc` (passphrase-encrypted). Legacy key `bfn_identity` is auto-migrated on load.
- Anonymous names: `anon_XXXX` format (4 random alphanumeric chars)
- Posts are cryptographically signed (ECDSA via BSV SDK)
- Users can copy/download their key for backup
- **Recovery files are single-key only.** `pathType` is `"save"` or `"restore-pre"`. Files are stamped with `fileVersion: 1`. Legacy plaintext files and files without a version stamp are rejected by `restore-from-file.ts` as `unsupported_version` — intentional "start clean" policy.
- **The key/address never changes.** Adding a passphrase calls `encryptInPlace`; changing a passphrase calls `changePassphrase`. Both re-encrypt the same underlying WIF in place. There is no key rotation, no sweep, no migration.
- **Manage gate:** the You modal verifies the passphrase once on entry (`manageAuthed` state); session destroyed on modal close or tab blur. Show recovery key + Restore still re-prompt (asymmetric by design — see DECISIONS.md).
- Dynamic imports for `@bsv/sdk` to avoid bundling issues
- Protection path: plaintext localStorage → passphrase encryption (`encryptInPlace`) → passkey wrapping → server HSM
- See DECISIONS.md for the full security upgrade plan

## UX Principles

- **User-facing language matters.** Avoid crypto jargon in normal UI copy. Use friendly equivalents:
  - "save your key" → "keep your name"
  - "fund your address" → "deposit slot"
  - "PIN" → "passphrase" (minimum 8 chars, not a 4-digit PIN)
  - **Exception:** Technical recovery artifacts (backup files, passphrase change flows, the Show recovery key panel) may use precise terms like "key" and "WIF" where clarity for recovery outweighs friendliness. The user is already in a technical context at that point.
- 2-click onboarding: visit site → type idea → click Post. Done.
- No wallet downloads, no seed phrases, no "buy crypto first"

## Security Notes

- Private keys stored in localStorage (acceptable for idea board phase, no real money yet)
- Server-side ECDSA signature verification on all posts
- Rate limiting on all mutation API routes and agent chat (sliding window). Keyed on IP via `x-forwarded-for` for API routes, on pubkey for server actions (createPost, bootPost). Read-only feed polling (`/api/posts`) is unrate-limited by design (hit every 5s by every client).
- boot-confirm hardened: replay protection, on-chain output verification, rate limiting
- CSP headers configured in next.config.ts (Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, Permissions-Policy)
- Node polyfills shimmed via next.config.ts for browser compatibility (empty-module.mjs)
- See SECURITY_AUDIT.md for full audit findings and fix status

## Deployment Notes

- **Rate limiting uses `x-forwarded-for` header** for IP identification. This header is client-supplied — behind a reverse proxy (Railway, Vercel, Cloudflare), the proxy sets it from the real client IP and it's trustworthy. If self-hosting without a proxy, attackers can spoof this header to bypass rate limits. Check your platform's docs for the correct trusted IP header (e.g. Vercel uses `x-real-ip`). All rate limit IP extraction is in the individual API route files (`src/app/api/*/route.ts`) and in `bootPost` (server action, reads `x-forwarded-for` → `x-real-ip` via `next/headers`). **Free-boot diagnostic:** the per-IP free-boot cap (`free-boot-cap.ts`) fails toward PAID on a missing/`unknown` IP — so if a deploy strips BOTH `x-forwarded-for` and `x-real-ip`, ALL free boots silently become paid (safe direction, but if "free boots stopped working / everything is paid," check the proxy is forwarding an IP header).

- **Environment variables.** See `.env.example` for the full list with inline comments. Highlights:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for AI agent chat (`/api/agent`)
  - `BSV_SERVER_WIF` — required for on-chain post logging (OP_RETURN). Without it, posts save to DB only with no on-chain fingerprint.
  - `DATABASE_PATH` — defaults to `./local.db`. Railway: set to `/data/local.db` with a mounted volume.
  - `PORT` — Railway sets this automatically. Vercel ignores it.

## Context Files

Read these to understand the full picture:

- **DIRECTION.md** — Where this project is going and why
- **DECISIONS.md** — Key decisions already made (don't relitigate these)
- **FAIRNESS.md** — Revenue distribution model, fairness formula, gaming analysis, phase progression
- **SECURITY_AUDIT.md** — Full security audit (2026-03-28): 9 criticals fixed, 3 highs fixed, mediums/lows tracked
- **ROADMAP.md** — What's done, what's next, what's planned
- **LAUNCH_PLAN.md** — Active launch-prep scratchpad (temporary; will be `git rm`'d at launch-close per memory `project_launch_plan_lifecycle.md`). 12 confirmed decisions, five work buckets, sequenced build plan
- **FUTURE.md** — Ideas and explorations not yet built (handles, AFP protocol, agents, boot signals)
- **SESSION_LOG.md** — What happened in each working session

## Hard Rules

These are non-negotiable. Do not bend them without explicit approval from the user.

1. **Read DECISIONS.md before proposing changes to identity, security, or fairness.** If a relevant decision exists, acknowledge it before proceeding. Do not relitigate settled decisions — if you want to challenge one, quote the original rationale, state what has changed, and ask first.
2. **No file deletes without confirmation.** Before deleting any file (not in node_modules/.next/build), state what will be deleted and why, and wait for explicit confirmation.
3. **Flag security regressions explicitly.** If a change weakens a control marked FIXED in SECURITY_AUDIT.md (removing rate limiting, relaxing signature verification, etc.), flag it as a security regression and require confirmation.
4. **Every session that modifies code must end with a git commit.** SESSION_LOG entry written, then commit. No leaving modified files uncommitted at session end.
5. **Update DECISIONS.md immediately when a decision is made**, not at session end. Decisions made mid-session affect subsequent work.
6. **No personal information in repo files.** Never write names, emails, usernames, or other identifying information into any committed file. Repo files are public — personal details belong only in memory files (which are local and not committed).
7. **Transaction handlers must use `requireIdentity()`.** Any handler needing a signed BSV identity (post, boot, tip, any future transaction) begins with `if (!requireIdentity() || !identity) return;` per the "Universal pattern: transaction action requires sign-in" section above. Do not directly call `signPost`, `clientSideBoot`, or any other wif-using service from a UI handler without this gate — it would silently fail when the user is locked instead of opening the SignInModal.
8. **Always ask before pushing to origin.** Commit locally without permission (per Hard Rule #4 — sessions must end with a git commit), but `git push` requires explicit user approval each time. Don't chain `git commit && git push` in one command. Don't assume "if I just committed, the user wants me to push" — they may want to test on another device, review the diff, or stage multiple commits before publishing. Push is a public action that affects the GitHub repo, deploy hooks, and any subscribers; commit is local. Treat them as different in tone and confirmation.

## Context Management

When you estimate you are above 70% of context capacity during a working session:

1. **At 70%**: Write a checkpoint — update SESSION_LOG.md with current state, what's done, what's next, what was ruled out. Continue working.
2. **At 80%**: Finish the current atomic unit of work (don't stop mid-edit). Commit all changes. Update ROADMAP.md and DECISIONS.md if anything changed.
3. **At 85%**: Stop new work. Tell the user: "Context is getting full — I've saved state. Start a new session to continue."

**SESSION_LOG entries must include:**
- What category of work was done (feature, security, refactor, etc.)
- Specific files changed and why
- What was explicitly ruled out or deferred
- What is still broken or incomplete
- The next step if the session ended mid-task

**Restart read order for new sessions:** CLAUDE.md → ROADMAP.md → DECISIONS.md → SESSION_LOG.md (last entry)

## AI Contribution Protocol

When you finish significant work on this project:

1. Update ROADMAP.md if you completed or started a task
2. Update DECISIONS.md if you made a non-obvious technical choice
3. Update FAIRNESS.md if you changed the revenue model, fairness parameters, or contribution scoring
4. Update DIRECTION.md only if the project direction changed
5. Update this file (CLAUDE.md) if you added new key files or changed architecture
6. Add a session summary to SESSION_LOG.md (date, 3-5 bullet points of what was done)
